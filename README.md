## 🌍 **Roots & Routes Africa**

### *Discover. Preserve. Experience.*

### 🔹 **Concept:**

A pan-African digital platform where communities **document their cultural heritage and invite the world to explore it virtually.** Elders, youth, and creators collaborate to tell the story of their people, places, and traditions — through videos, audio, and immersive experiences.

It’s part **digital archive**, part **tourism guide**, and part **youth storytelling project**.
